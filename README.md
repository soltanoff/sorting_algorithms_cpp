# Sorting algorithms for C++

The Python project is aimed at testing the implementations of algorithms for sorting the elements of an array (list).

The computational complexity of the algorithms (O-symbolism) is estimated, and algorithms for correctness are also verified.


List of algorithms (sorted by measured speed):
1) Timsort;
2) Quick sorting (Hoare);
3) Radix sorting (LSD);
4) Sorting by merge;
5) Heap sorting;
6) Sorting by simple extraction;
7) Sorting by simple inclusion;
8) Sort by bubble;
9) Sort by counting.



Used: C++14, cmake v3.7+
